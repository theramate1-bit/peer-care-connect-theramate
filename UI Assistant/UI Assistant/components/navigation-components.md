# Navigation Components

## What is this?

Navigation components are the menu systems that help users move around your site: main navigation bars, mobile menus, breadcrumbs, pagination.

**What it looks like:** Horizontal menu bars, hamburger menus, dropdown menus, breadcrumb trails, page numbers.

**When to use it:** Every site needs navigation. Use different types based on your site structure and screen size.

## Why use this?

Navigation components solve wayfinding problems:

1. **Orientation:** Users always know where they are
2. **Discovery:** Users can find all sections
3. **Efficiency:** Quick access to important pages
4. **Consistency:** Same navigation everywhere

**User Benefit:** Users can easily navigate your site and find what they're looking for.

**Design Principle:** Follows user expectations - navigation should be where users expect it (top of page). Also follows consistency - navigation should be the same across pages.

## Step-by-Step Implementation

See [Navigation Layout Pattern](../layouts/navigation.md) for detailed implementation.

## Exact Specifications

See [Navigation Layout Pattern](../layouts/navigation.md) for exact specifications.

## Source Reference

This pattern comes from:
- Transcript: "Generalized Framer Design Patterns for LLM Recreation (Portfolio Analysis).md"
- Key concepts: Navigation often simple, sometimes hamburger menu. Minimal navigation keeps focus on work.

## Common Variations

1. **Horizontal Nav:** Standard top navigation
2. **Hamburger Menu:** Mobile menu icon
3. **Sidebar Nav:** Vertical navigation on side
4. **Breadcrumbs:** Shows current location
5. **Pagination:** Page numbers for lists

## Things to Avoid

1. **Too Many Items:** Limit to 5-7 main items
2. **Hidden Navigation:** Should be easy to find
3. **Inconsistent:** Same navigation everywhere
4. **No Active State:** Show current page
5. **Poor Mobile:** Must work on mobile
