# Consistency

## What is this?

Consistency means using the same patterns, colors, and styles throughout your design. Buttons look the same everywhere, colors are used the same way, spacing follows the same system.

**Why it matters:** Consistent designs are easier to learn and use. Users don't have to figure out new patterns on every screen.

## How to Maintain Consistency

1. **Design System:** Use a design system with defined colors, fonts, spacing
2. **Components:** Reuse the same components (buttons, cards, inputs)
3. **Patterns:** Use the same patterns for similar situations
4. **Spacing:** Use consistent spacing scale (8px, 16px, 24px, etc.)
