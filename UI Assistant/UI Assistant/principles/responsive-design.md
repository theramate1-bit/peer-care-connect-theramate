# Responsive Design

## What is this?

Responsive design means your interface works on all screen sizes - phones, tablets, and desktops. Layouts adapt, text sizes adjust, and navigation changes for different screens.

**Why it matters:** Most users are on mobile devices. Your design must work on small screens.

## Key Principles

1. **Mobile First:** Design for mobile first, then scale up
2. **Flexible Layouts:** Use percentages, flexbox, grid (not fixed pixels)
3. **Breakpoints:** Define screen sizes where layout changes (375px, 768px, 1440px)
4. **Touch Targets:** Larger buttons/targets on mobile (44px minimum)

## Breakpoints

- **Mobile:** 375px - 767px
- **Tablet:** 768px - 1439px
- **Desktop:** 1440px+
