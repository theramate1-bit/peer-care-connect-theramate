# Visual Hierarchy

## What is this?

Visual hierarchy is the arrangement of elements to show their order of importance. Important things are bigger, brighter, or more prominent. Less important things are smaller, lighter, or less prominent.

**Why it matters:** Users need to know where to look first. Without hierarchy, everything competes for attention and users get confused.

## How to Create Hierarchy

1. **Size:** Bigger = more important
2. **Color:** Brighter/more saturated = more important
3. **Spacing:** More space around = more important
4. **Position:** Top/center = more important
5. **Contrast:** Higher contrast = more important
