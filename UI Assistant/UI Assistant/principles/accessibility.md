# Accessibility

## What is this?

Accessibility means designing so everyone can use your interface, including people with disabilities. This includes color contrast, text size, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support.

**Why it matters:** Everyone should be able to use your design. Accessibility also improves the experience for all users.

## Key Requirements

1. **Color Contrast:** Text must have sufficient contrast (4.5:1 minimum)
2. **Text Size:** Minimum 14px, preferably 16px
3. **Touch Targets:** Minimum 44px × 44px on mobile
4. **Keyboard Navigation:** All interactive elements should be keyboard accessible
5. **Alt Text:** Images need descriptive alt text
