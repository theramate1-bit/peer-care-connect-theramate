# User Intent

## What is this?

User intent is understanding what users are trying to accomplish when they visit your site or use your app. Design should solve user problems, not just look good.

**Why it matters:** If you don't understand what users want to do, you'll design the wrong things. Start with user goals, then design around them.

## How to Design for Intent

1. **Identify the Goal:** What is the user trying to do?
2. **Start with Core Action:** Build around the main action (search, buy, read)
3. **Remove Obstacles:** Don't add things that don't help the user
4. **Progressive Disclosure:** Show what's needed, reveal more as required

- Key concepts: Start with user intent. The intent of the user is to search for accommodations, so a search bar is the natural starting point. Don't add things that don't help the user.
